# ASD Project

Shaping up to be a transport card management app.
App available here: http://prod-asdproject.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com

## Running the react boilerplate

Ensure that npm is installed. Navigate into the frontend directory and use the following commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```

Just a test of git committing/pushing, disregard this.
